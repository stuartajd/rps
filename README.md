# Rock Paper Scissors

A very basic game of Rock Paper Scissors for NodeJS.

## Installation
>To install required modules
```
npm install
```
>To run the actual game itself
```
npm run rps
```

## Final notes
It took about 10 minutes to create this as I was simply just trying some new things, it's relatively simply done so any comments on how my code can be improved are welcome!
